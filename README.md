# Loan Status Prediction
As part of the Machine Learning with Python Course by IBM on Coursera, the following Jupyter notebook is my project submission that aims to use the following classifiers to predict the likelihood of an indivifual paying off their loan. Each of the models given below outputs a single label `'PAIDOFF'` or `'COLLECTION'`

Models used:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

The description and steps taken to do the modeling is dictated in the notebook.
